# Cat-Clicker

This project is created as part of Udacity Course Javascript Design Patterns.

This project demonstrates the organization of code in Model, View and Controller using jQuery.

The project is a simple application which increments the number of clicks when a user clicks on a cat image. Also, the code provides scope for data manipulation.
